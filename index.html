# Ash McKenzie

<h3 style="margin-top: -40px">Tech Lead DevOps Engineer</h3>

???

* Bit about me..
* APAC Tech Lead which includes the Melbourne and Singapore offices
* At Zendesk 18 months, come from a more software engineering background, prefer the system problem space
* If I wasn't getting down and dirty with DevOps work, I'd be working with arduino, micro controllers or what is now called the IoT

* Cloud based customer service platform
* What does that mean?  We help our customers help their customers :)
* Some of our customers include - Rockstar Games, Uber, Shopify, Groupon, Twilio

class: topic-template

# Why Docker?

<br/>
* `Dockerfile`, so easy! <i class="twa twa-joy"></i>
* Application isolation
* Application and operating environment described in a single repository <i class="twa twa-joy"></i> <i class="twa twa-joy"></i>
* Docker Hub
* Permeated our workflow for experimentation
* So much <i class="twa twa-heart"></i> from all teams

???

* Dockerfile - a simple yet powerful concept that both developers and sysadmins can leverage
* The beautiful feeling of describing your application and your operating environment in a single repository

---

# POD architecture

???

* Now for some context
* Lets take a minute to talk about Zendesk's pod architecture

---

layout: true
class: topic-template

# POD architecture

???

* Here's a rough overview of a pod
* A Pod is a self-containted Zendesk stack that we have duplicated in 11 locations all over the world
* The challenge for is to grow each pod as our customer base grows

## Samson

[github.com/zendesk/samson](https://github.com/zendesk/samson)

* Transparent
* Flexible
* Audit trail
* Our (open source) deployment tool

???

* Flexible - essentially a script runner

# Deployment > Samson

# Project X

---

layout: true
class: topic-template

# Project X

---

## Goals

* Assemble a team of engineers from all offices
* Rapidly deploy new services & applications with little involvement from Ops
* Easily scale up instances that run services & applications
* Leverage cloud providers for speed and flexibility

???

* We've traditionally have not ventured into cloud providers due to data compliancy challenges

---

## Implementation

* Utilised Samson, Docker and consul
* X agent running on each node watches consul, for a new 'release document'
* Pulls down docker images, builds as described in release document

---

Release document example:

```json
{
  "doc_version": "1.0",
  "release_id": "10883",
  "release_author": "Bat Man <batman@zendesk.com>",
  "release_at": "2015-05-02 22:30:05 +0000",
  "image": "docker-registry.com/app@sha256:94c02c355ae42a9adc12f3fca6727a2d59afe1d9",
  "env": {
    "RAILS_ENV": "production",
  },
  "encryption_key": "vault:x_encryption_key_1",
  "roles": {
    "resque_worker": {
      "command": "bundle exec rake resque:worker",
    }
  }
}
```

---

## Outcome

* It worked!
* Integrated into Samson
* Ultimately shelved because:
  * Scaling up instances was still challenging
  * Other technologies had matured, namely Kubernetes

???

* Before Docker swarm was stable

# Kubernetes

<img src="./images/kubernetes-logo.png" width="20%" />

---

layout: true
class: topic-template

# Kubernetes

---

## Why Kubernetes?

* Similar core concepts to Project X (release doc vs. pod definition file)
* API drive, Samson can still drive
* Supports Open Container Format (OCF) - Docker & Rocket
* Maintained by a large group of contributors (560 according to GitHub!)

---

## Xmas 2015

First production release!  Stay tuned <i class="twa twa-smile"></i>

???

* Aiming for first production application running using Kubernetes before Xmas.

# Tips

---

name: tips-debian

## `FROM debian:latest`

<img class="logo" src="./images/debian-logo.png" />

Latest Debian, comes in at 119MB.

???

For reference, Ubuntu 14.04 is 179MB

---

name: tips-alpine

## `FROM alpine:latest`

<img class="logo" src="./images/alpine-linux-logo.png" />

A minimal Docker image based on Alpine Linux with a complete package index and only 5 MB in size!

## Shoreman

[github.com/chrismytton/shoreman](https://github.com/chrismytton/shoreman)

Bash implementation of Foreman that parses a file called `Procfile` without the need for Ruby.

Procfiles are portable and parseable by Foreman (Ruby), Honcho (Python), Forego (golang), etc.

???

* Foreman originally developed for the Heroku platform
* Are you sensing a theme with the project names?!? :)

class: topic-template

# Tips > Shoreman

---

`Procfile` structure:

```ruby
<label1>: <command1>
<label2>: <label2>
...
```

Example:

```ruby
crond:   crond -f -d 6
app_log: tail -f ${APP_LOG_FILE}
```

---

`Dockerfile` example:

```docker
FROM alpine:latest
ENV APP_LOG_FILE /var/log/uptime.log
RUN apk --update add bash ca-certificates
RUN wget https://github.com/chrismytton/shoreman/raw/master/shoreman.sh -O /usr/local/bin/shoreman && \
chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/shoreman
RUN echo "*/1 * * * * uptime >> ${APP_LOG_FILE}" | crontab -
RUN touch /var/log/uptime.log
COPY Procfile /
ENTRYPOINT [ "/usr/local/bin/shoreman" ]
```

---

`Procfile` example

```ruby
crond:   crond -f -d 6
app_log: tail -f ${APP_LOG_FILE}
```

Output:

```shell
$ docker build -t docker_demo
$ docker run -ti docker_demo
01:26:44 crond	| '/usr/sbin/crond -f -d 6' started with pid 6
01:26:44 crond	| crond: crond (busybox 1.23.2) started, log level 6
01:26:44 app_log	| 'tail -f ${APP_LOG_FILE}' started with pid 12
01:27:00 crond	| crond: USER root pid  19 cmd uptime >> /var/log/uptime.log
01:27:00 app_log	| 01:27:00 up  9:54,  0 users,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.04
```

???

* This Procfile will run the cron daemon and also tail the application and cron logs, very useful!
